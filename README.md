Circle Detection for Antibiotic Resistance in Bacteria using OpenCV - Python.

In this study, it is aimed to protect the healthy state in human health and to prevent possible disease states.
A technological, safe and efficient method has been proposed to monitor the data. Ë™For human health
It is of critical importance to be able to predict disease states that have or have the potential to have negative effects. Pharmacology and Pathology deals with these issues. In these studies
Detection, analysis and classification of bacterial organisms are of great importance. With the development of technology, image processing was used in these experiments on bacteria.
Its use has offered a strong alternative to old and traditional human-made measurement techniques. This alternative option; It is advantageous in terms of time, reliability and efficiency.
The recommended option is by detecting bacteria on the petri dish with Computer Vision.
It starts. Grayscale functions are applied to captured images. These images are then subjected to the blurring function. The resulting candidate shapes are Circular Hough
Parameters are sent to the Transformation. Applying Circular Hough Transform on them
is provided. After this stage, the radii of the circles found to detect bacteria are:
The circle is found with the center finding function. According to these center and circle size measurements
radius calculation is made. The classification of bacteria is completed by matching these radii with the code of the bacteria to which the radii belong. This classification is necessary
It is used in disease treatment or prediction.
